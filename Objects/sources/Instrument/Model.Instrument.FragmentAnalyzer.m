	Description->"Model information for the array-based capillary electrophoresis instrument used for parallel qualitative or quantitative analysis of nucleic acids via separation based on analyte fragment size. A strong electric field (electrophoresis) is applied across an extremely thin, hollow tube (a capillary) containing a porous medium (gel solution) and facilitates the size-dependent migration of analytes in the sample. Depending on the attached CapillaryArray part, the analysis of either 12-, 48- or 96- samples in a single, parallel run can be performed and allows for high- to ultra-high throughput workflows.",
