	Description->"Analysis of image data objects that identifies optimally exposed image and calculates suggested exposure time for improperly exposed images. Optimal image is selected from a list of acceptable images satisfying specific statistical measures, including entropy, under/over-exposed pixel fractions. For acceptable bright field images, the best image corresponds to the image with the highest entropy. For fluorescence images, it corresponds to the image with the least amount of over exposed pixels.",
