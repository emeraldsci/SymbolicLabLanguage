ColloidalStability makes DLS measurements at various dilutions of a sample below 25 mg/mL to calculate the diffusion interaction parameter (kD) and the second virial coefficient (B22 or A2), and does the same for a sample of mass concentration 20-100 mg/mL to calculate the Kirkwood-Buff Integral (G22) at each dilution concentration; Static Light Scattering (SLS) measurements can be used to calculate A2 and the molecular weight of the analyte. MeltingCurve makes DLS measurements over a range of temperatures in order to calculate melting temperature (Tm), temperature of aggregation (Tagg), and temperature of onset of unfolding (Tonset). IsothermalStability makes multiple DLS measurements at a single temperature over time in order to probe stability of the analyte at a particular temperature.",
