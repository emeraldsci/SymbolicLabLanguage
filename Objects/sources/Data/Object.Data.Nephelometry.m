			Description->"The type of experiment nephelometric measurements are collected for. CellCount involves measuring the amount of scattered light from cells suspended in solution in order to quantify the number of cells in solution. CellCountParameterizaton involves measuring the amount of scattered light from a series of diluted samples from a cell culture, and quantifying the cells by another method, such as making titers, plating, incubating, and counting colonies, or by counting with a microscope. A standard curve is then created with the data to relate cell count to nephelometry readings for future cell count quantification. For the method Solubility, scattered light from suspended particles in solution will be measured, at a single time point or over a time period. Reagents can be injected into the samples to study their effects on solubility, and dilutions can be performed to determine the point of saturation.",
