	Description->"A frame that can stack on top of other containers and can have containers or lids stacked on it. The spacer has openings on both the top and bottom and provides a gap between the containers above and below it. This allows extra clear height for items below which push above the surface, and also allows containers such as filters which pass liquid through to be positioned above a collection container below the spacer.",
