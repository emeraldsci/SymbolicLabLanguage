				Description->"The device on which the protocol is run. The instrument is loaded with a cartridge that holds the capillary in which Capillary gel Electrophoresis-Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (CESDS) is performed as well as the anode running buffer required for this experiment. Samples are first denatured by heating in the presence of SDS, imparting all proteins in the sample a negative charge and a similar charge to mass ratio. For every sample, separation matrix is loaded onto the capillary and the sample is electroinjected into the matrix. Subsequently, a voltage is applied on the capillary and proteins migrate through the sieving matrix where smaller proteins migrate faster than larger ones. Proteins are detected as they migrate past a UV absorbance detector and relative migration times are calculated relative to an internal standard.",
