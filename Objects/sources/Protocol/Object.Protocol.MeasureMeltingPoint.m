			Description -> "Determines the method used to adjust the measured temperatures obtained from the apparatus's temperature sensor. When set to \"Pharmacopeia\", the temperatures are adjusted using Pharmacopeia melting point standards; when set to \"Thermodynamic\", thermodynamic melting point standards are utilized for temperature adjustments. In \"Pharmacopeia\" mode, adjustments are based on experimental measurements following pharmacopeial guidelines. This method neglects the furnace temperature being slightly higher than the sample temperature during heating, leading to dependency on heating rate for comparability. In contrast, \"Thermodynamic\" mode provides a physically accurate melting point that represents the theoretical temperature at which a substance transitions from solid to liquid phase under standard conditions.",
