# SymbolicLabLanguage

The Symbolic Lab Language is developed by Emerald Cloud Lab for interacting with cloud laboratories through a Mathematica Notebook. 

## Getting Started

### Cloning the repository

You should clone the repository to a location on your Mathematica `$Path` (a good location for this is your home directory, `~` or `%userprofile%`). From a terminal:

```sh
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:emeraldsci/SymbolicLabLanguage.git
```

### Updating Trusted Directories

In order for our documentation notebooks to work correctly, the repository much be in on of the Mathematica "Trusted Directories". The easiest way to do this is to update this setting to include the location of the newly cloned repository.

1. Navigate to the Mathematica preferences through the File menu.
2. Select the "Security" tab.
3. Click "Edit Trusted Directories..."
4. Click the "Add" button.
5. Enter the following in the input field and click OK.
    ```Mathematica
    FrontEnd`FileName[{$HomeDirectory,"SymbolicLabLanguage"}]
    ```
6. When asked "Are you sure" hit OK.

### Loading Packages

You can use `Get[]` to load all the SLL packages quickly in the notebook as follows:

```Mathematica
<<SymbolicLabLanguage`
```

For further information regarding packaging and loading specific packages, see the [Packager Documentation](Packager/README.md)

### Logging In

To perform any operations against the database, you must be logged in. To do so, use the `Login[]` function after loading SLL with your username/password.

```Mathematica
In[1]:= <<SymbolicLabLanguage`
In[2]:= Login["example@emeraldcloudlab.com"] (* will prompt for password *)
Out[2]= True
In[3]:= Download[Object[Data,Example,"aXRlGnZmwp4m"]]
Out[3]= <|ID->Object[Data,Example,aXRlGnZmwp4m],Type->Object[Data,Example],Name->"My Favourite Object"|>
```
