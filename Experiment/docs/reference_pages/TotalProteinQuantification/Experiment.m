		"When AssayType -> Bradford, a Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay is performed. For more information about compatible reagents and troubleshooting, please see Object[Report,Literature,\"Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay Instruction Manual\"].",
		"When AssayType -> BCA, a Pierce BCA Protein Assay is performed. For more information about compatible reagents and troubleshooting, please see Object[Report,Literature,\"Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit Instructions\"].",
		"When AssayType -> FluorescenceQuantification, a Quant-iT Protein Assay is performed. For more information about compatible reagents and troubleshooting, please see Object[Report, Literature, \"Quant-iT Protein Assay Kit User Guide\"].",
		"The protein quantification experiment is carried out in a 96-well plate of model Model[Container, Plate, \"96-well Black Wall Greiner Plate\"].",
		"If multiple QuantificationWavelengths are specified, the absorbance or fluorescence values of each from those wavelengths will be averaged to create the standard curve used for protein quantification.",
		"The average calculated TotalProteinConcentration is uploaded to each unique input sample. This average takes into account NumberOfReplicates, as well as any dilution of input samples using the Aliquot Sample Preparation options."
