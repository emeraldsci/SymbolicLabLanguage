			"    - To indicate that samples should be pooled, wrap the corresponding input samples in additional curly brackets, as shown in the examples below, e.g. {{s1,s2},{s3,s4}}.",
			"    - Providing samples or container vessels in a flat list indicates that each sample should be measured individually and not be pooled.",
			"    - Providing samples in a plate indicates that each sample in the plate should be measured individually ({myPlate}). If you wish to pool all samples in the plate, wrap the plate in additional list, e.g. {{myPlate}}.",
			"    - There is no upper limit as to how many samples can be pooled for this experiment, provided that the total volume of the samples plus buffer(s) is less than or equal to the MaxVolume of Model[Container, Plate, \"96-well 500uL Round Bottom DSC Plate\"].",
			"Prior to the aliquotting of sample(s) and buffer(s) into the plate, the individual samples can be subjected to Incubation, Centrifugation, and Filtering using the shared SamplePreparation framework. Default options and option resolutions apply.",
			"    - Sample preparation options for the input samples can be provided by singletons, values index-matched to the number of pools, or via a nested list matching the SamplesIn.",
			"The aliquotting / pooling of sample(s) and buffer(s) into the plate is performed using the shared Aliquot SamplePreparation framework. All options and default option resolution apply, some of which are listed here for clarity.",
			"    - If NONE of AssayVolume, AliquotAmount, and TargetConcentration are specified, the experiment function assumes that no dilution is desired and the samples will be pooled into the plate without addition of buffer.",
			"    - If AssayBuffer is not provided, but required because AssayVolume or TargetConcentration dictate it, it will automatically be set to Model[Sample, \"Milli-Q water\"].",
			"    - The plate in which the sample(s) should be measured can be provided via the option AliquotContainer. If AliquotContainer is not specified, and a transfer into a plate is needed, it will automatically be set to Model[Container, Plate, \"96-well 500uL Round Bottom DSC Plate\"].",
			"The pooled sample inside the plate can be subjected to additional mixing and incubation, if desired, via the NestedIndexMatchingMix -> True and NestedIndexMatchingIncubate -> True bool options, plus their affiliated parameters.",
			"    - Mixing of the plate: If pooling of sample(s) and buffer occurred, mixing of the pool inside the plate defaults to True. Mixing is performed by vortexing and controlled by the PooledMixRate option.",
			"    - Incubation of the plate: Incubation of the sample/pool inside the plate will not be set to True unless indicated by the user."
