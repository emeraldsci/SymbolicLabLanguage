			"The count of the tablets in a particular sample is measured by dividing the total mass of the sample by the average tablet weight.",
			"The average tablet weight is determined by a process called tablet parameterization where 10 tablets (or as specified by the user) are measured individually to determine the average TabletWeight (stored in the Model[Sample]).",
			"The total mass of the sample is determined by the  execution of a MeasureWeight subprotocol during the MeasureCount experiment.",
			"By default, tablet parameterization and total-weight measurements are only performed when the TabletWeight or the Mass of the sample are not yet known, respectively.",
			"The user has the option to force the tablet parameterization and/or total-weight measurement, independent of the TabletWeight and the Mass being known, by setting the options ParameterizeTablets and MeasureTotalWeight, respectively.",
			"In these cases the TabletWeight and Mass recorded previously are overwritten by the newly determined values."
