		"ExperimentCapillaryELISA uses special cartridge plates with parallel microfluidics channels. The cartridge is loaded with samples and assay reagents. During capillary ELISA experiment, samples and reagents are directed into and out of the microfluidics channels through a series of pneumatic pistons to complete the entire workflow of a sandwich ELISA experiment.",
		"Each capillary ELISA cartridge is pre-loaded with streptavidin-conjugated fluorophore reagents, which can specifically recognize biotinylated detection antibodies in the sandwich ELISA. The fluorophore reagents are excited by a single mode 641nm laser diode and the fluorescence signals at 650 nm are detected by a CCD camera for quantitation of the analyte concentrations.",
		"Each microfluidics channel in capillary ELISA cartridge contains multiple Glass Nano-Reactors (GNR) that are functionalized with immunoassay reagents. Each GNR provides a single measurement so the experiment provides internal replicates for ELISA experiment. For each replicated measurement, a fluorescence signal value is provided by averaging approximately 50 readings at the specific GNR.",
		"There are five types of capillary ELISA cartridges. The cartridge type Customizable can be loaded with the user's antibody reagents and used for customized ELISA experiments. The other cartridge types - SinglePlex72X1, MultiAnalyte32X4, MultiAnalyte16X4 and MultiPlex32X8 - are pre-loaded with validated ELISA assays, available for more than 200 analytes. Different pre-loaded cartridge types provide different sample numbers, analyte numbers and internal replicates:",
